    <h2>About Paneer</h2>
    <p>
        Paneer, also known as panir, is a soft, non-melting, non-aged cheese that's a common ingredient in Indian and other South Asian cuisines. It's made from full-fat buffalo or cow's milk that's curdled with an acid derived from fruit or vegetables, like lemon juice, yogurt, or vinegar. The curdled milk is then strained and pressed with a heavy object, resulting in a spongy cheese that absorbs flavors well and can retain its firmness even when cooked or fried

    <p>
        Paneer is a good source of protein and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which may help lower blood pressure. Eating paneer daily may also have other health benefits, such as improving bone health, boosting immunity, and promoting heart health. However, it's best to consume it in moderation and choose low-fat options. Paneer can be eaten raw with some black pepper, or used in many dishes, including curries, side dishes, and tikka.
