    <h1>DOSA</h1>
    <h2>The Story of DOSA</h2>
    <p>
        The origins of dosa, a popular South Indian breakfast dish, are somewhat mysterious. Some food historians believe dosa originated in the 1st century AD in ancient Tamil country, based on references to dosa-like foods in Sangam literature. Others, like historian P. Thankappan Nair, believe dosa originated in the town of Udipi in present-day Karnataka, possibly around the 5th century AD. In 1054 AD, Chalukya King Somesvara III wrote about dosa in Tamil literature, and a recipe similar to dosa appears in the 12th century Sanskrit text Manasollasa    </p>

        Dosa is made from rice and urad beans that are fermented using a combination of bacteria and yeasts. The rice crepe is often served with chutneys made from coconut, tomato, and coriander, along with sambar. The most popular version of dosa is masala dosa, which has a spiced potato filling.
