    <h2><i>Description</i></h2>
    <p>I have made so many types of biryani, but i would say that dum biryani is the real one and has the real taste to it. I love pressure cooker biryani and one pot biryani as well but nothing can beat a dum biryani when it is properly made. Have few dum biryani recipes in my blog. There are certain steps in making the perfect biryani..I have given everything perfectly here. I think this will help you a lot.

    <p>Think everyone know that making biryani is a kind of art. Yes each step is really important in that, but with a little patience and practice you can become a biryani master. Specially ramzan biryani is one which sat in my to do list for ages. I finally thought to give it a try. I was so careful in each step and took my own time to prepare everything, since it was my first attempt. But the result was awesome. The biryani came out with full of flavour and everyone loved it
